# deeplearning_netflix
A deep learning-based recommendation system using the Netflix Prize dataset. Implements Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) in PyTorch and compares it with SVD and ALS baselines. Includes preprocessing, feature engineering, EDA, and evaluation with RMSE/MAE. Future work explores AutoRec and BERT4Rec.
